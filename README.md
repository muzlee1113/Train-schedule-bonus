# Train-Scheduler

This is a train schedule displaying website that help me practice Javascript and firebase.

## Getting Started and Steps
The time for now and the next arrival and the minutes away will show up on the screen.
If you enter the train name, the time for the first train and the frequency of the train, the new train will be added to the firebase and return you the schedule.
You can get updates by either refreshing the page or hit the update button.
You can delete a train by clicking the specific remove button.
You can sign in with your google or github account.
